// to-do

// if source audio is not stereo, process it instead of throwing an error.

// I think I'm applying window effect to the actual signal. The resulting audio fades in and out. I should apply the 
// window to a reference to the actual audio instead.

// samples clip at times (past -1 or 1). Might be because of uninitialize sampleStorage size.
// initiaized sampleStorage size and still have issue...

// increase amount of bins. 
// you can do this by increasing fft size (increases time it takes).
// You can also change the bins from linear to exponential.

// 5295744 (2 seconds)
// if sample storage exceeds this size, cancel everything and make the wav with it's data.

// add a normalisation feature that compresses the audio.

// It takes a while to fetch audio from s3 and make the audio and then read the audio... more efficieny would be great... store in cache
// It also takes a while to upload to s3.

// Make a unique object key for every upload and send the key to server.
